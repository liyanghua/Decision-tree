The design
-------------------------
1. attribute names and values.

attribute name contains a type: discrete or CONTINUOUS(TODO).
currently only support discrete type.

each attribute name has a list of values.

2. instance and instance bag.
A instance denotes a record in the data file.
Each instance contains a list of attribute values.
Please note that we only store the index in each instance(not the actually string value) of the attribute values to save space.
The actual string values are only stored in instancebag

Instance bag is the container of instance. It contains a list of instance and all the attribute names in the data
file.

3. Node and Tree.
In this implementation, we did not design different data structures for each node type such as leaf node or internal node.
in the DTreeNode structure, if attr_name_index is not equal to -1, then it is the internal node, if label_index is not 
equal to -1, then it is the leaf node.

We use information gain to select the best split attribute for current node.
When the Entropy of the node is 0 or we used up all the attributes along the path from root to current node, we stop growing 
tree.

4. tree pruning.(TODO)
